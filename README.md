# rav1d-safe

A safe Rust AV1 decoder. Forked from [rav1d](https://github.com/memorysafety/rav1d), with 160k lines of hand-written x86/ARM assembly replaced by safe Rust SIMD intrinsics.

578 commits since the fork (+90,813 / -6,958 lines across 1,194 files). 68k of those net new lines are safe SIMD in `src/safe_simd/`.

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
rav1d-safe = "0.3"
```

Decode an AV1 bitstream:
```rust
use rav1d_safe::{Decoder, Planes};

fn decode(obu_data: &[u8]) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut decoder = Decoder::new()?;

    // Feed raw OBU data (not IVF/WebM containers)
    if let Some(frame) = decoder.decode(obu_data)? {
        println!("{}x{} @ {}bpc", frame.width(), frame.height(), frame.bit_depth());

        match frame.planes() {
            Planes::Depth8(planes) => {
                for row in planes.y().rows() {
                    // row is &[u8] — zero-copy, no allocation
                }
            }
            Planes::Depth16(planes) => {
                let px = planes.y().pixel(0, 0); // 10 or 12-bit value
            }
        }
    }

    // Drain any buffered frames
    for frame in decoder.flush()? {
        // ...
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## API Overview

The public API lives in `src/managed.rs` and is re-exported at the crate root.

**Core types:**

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Decoder` | Decodes AV1 OBU data into frames |
| `Frame` | Decoded frame with metadata (cloneable, Arc-backed) |
| `Planes` | Enum dispatching to `Planes8` or `Planes16` by bit depth |
| `PlaneView8` / `PlaneView16` | Zero-copy 2D view with `row()`, `pixel()`, `rows()` |
| `Settings` | Thread count, film grain, filters, frame size limit, CPU level |
| `CpuLevel` | SIMD dispatch level (Scalar, X86V2, X86V3, X86V4, Neon, Native) |
| `Error` | Enum: `InvalidData`, `OutOfMemory`, `NeedMoreData`, etc. |

**Metadata types:** `ColorInfo`, `ColorPrimaries`, `TransferCharacteristics`, `MatrixCoefficients`, `ColorRange`, `ContentLightLevel`, `MasteringDisplay`, `PixelLayout`

### Input Format

The decoder expects raw AV1 Open Bitstream Unit (OBU) data. If you have IVF or WebM containers, strip the container framing first and pass the OBU payload. See `tests/ivf_parser.rs` for an IVF parser example. For AVIF images, use [zenavif-parse](https://crates.io/crates/zenavif-parse) to extract the OBU data from the ISOBMFF container.

### Threading

```rust
use rav1d_safe::{Decoder, Settings, CpuLevel};

// Single-threaded (default) — synchronous, deterministic
let decoder = Decoder::new()?;

// Multi-threaded — frame threading, better throughput
let decoder = Decoder::with_settings(Settings {
    threads: 0, // auto-detect core count
    ..Default::default()
})?;

// Constrained decoding — limit frame size and CPU features
let decoder = Decoder::with_settings(Settings {
    frame_size_limit: 3840 * 2160, // reject frames larger than 4K
    cpu_level: CpuLevel::Native,   // use best available SIMD
    ..Default::default()
})?;
```

With `threads >= 2` or `threads == 0`, the decoder uses frame threading. `decode()` may return `None` for complete frames because processing is asynchronous — call it repeatedly or use `flush()` to drain.

**Multithreading requires the `unchecked` feature:**

```toml
rav1d-safe = { version = "0.4", features = ["bitdepth_8", "bitdepth_16", "unchecked"] }
```

Without `unchecked`, the decoder silently falls back to single-threaded mode. With 2 threads, expect ~2x speedup on photo decode (4K: 255ms → 128ms).

### HDR Metadata

```rust
if let Some(cll) = frame.content_light() {
    println!("MaxCLL: {} nits", cll.max_content_light_level);
}
if let Some(mdcv) = frame.mastering_display() {
    println!("Peak: {} nits", mdcv.max_luminance_nits());
}
let color = frame.color_info();
// color.primaries, color.transfer_characteristics, color.matrix_coefficients
```

### Error Handling

All fallible operations return `Result<T, rav1d_safe::Error>`. Error variants: `InvalidData`, `OutOfMemory`, `NeedMoreData`, `InitFailed`, `InvalidSettings`, `Other`.

## Safety Model

The default build (`forbid(unsafe_code)` crate-wide) contains zero `unsafe` in the main crate. The only unsafe code lives in the [rav1d-disjoint-mut](crates/rav1d-disjoint-mut/) workspace sub-crate, a provably sound `RefCell`-for-ranges abstraction with always-on bounds checking.

The SIMD path uses:
- [archmage](https://crates.io/crates/archmage) for token-based target-feature dispatch (no manual `#[target_feature]`)
- [safe_unaligned_simd](https://crates.io/crates/safe_unaligned_simd) for reference-based SIMD load/store (no raw pointers)
- Value-type SIMD intrinsics, which are safe functions since Rust 1.93
- Slice-based APIs throughout — no pointer arithmetic in SIMD code

Verify at runtime with `rav1d_safe::enabled_features()` — returns a comma-delimited list including the active safety level (e.g. `"bitdepth_8, bitdepth_16, safety:forbid-unsafe"`).

## What's Been Ported

The default build compiles under `forbid(unsafe_code)` in the main crate. All SIMD work lives in `src/safe_simd/` (59k lines of safe Rust replacing 233k lines of hand-written assembly across x86 and ARM).

### Ported: All DSP Kernels (AVX2 + NEON)

Every DSP kernel family has a safe Rust SIMD implementation that compiles under `forbid(unsafe_code)`:

| Module | x86 ASM replaced | ARM ASM replaced | Safe Rust |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| mc (motion compensation) | 3 files (SSE/AVX2/AVX-512) x2 bitdepths | 4 files (32+64-bit) x2 bitdepths + SVE/dotprod | `mc.rs` + `mc_arm.rs` |
| itx (inverse transforms) | 3 files x2 bitdepths | 2 files x2 bitdepths | `itx.rs` + `itx_arm.rs` |
| ipred (intra prediction) | 3 files x2 bitdepths | 2 files x2 bitdepths | `ipred.rs` + `ipred_arm.rs` |
| cdef (directional enhancement) | 3 files x2 bitdepths | 2+tmpl files x2 bitdepths | `cdef.rs` + `cdef_arm.rs` |
| loopfilter | 3 files x2 bitdepths | 2 files x2 bitdepths | `loopfilter.rs` + `loopfilter_arm.rs` |
| looprestoration (Wiener + SGR) | 3 files x2 bitdepths | 2+common+tmpl files x2 bitdepths | `looprestoration.rs` + `looprestoration_arm.rs` |
| filmgrain | 3+common files x2 bitdepths | 2 files x2 bitdepths | `filmgrain.rs` + `filmgrain_arm.rs` |
| pal (palette) | 1 file | *(none — ARM uses scalar)* | `pal.rs` |
| refmvs (reference MVs) | 1 file | 2 files (32+64-bit) | `refmvs.rs` + `refmvs_arm.rs` |
| msac (entropy decoder) | 1 file (shared) | 1 file (shared) | inline in `msac.rs` |
| cpuid | 1 file (55 lines) | — | replaced by `std::arch` detection in `cpu.rs` |

msac uses branchless scalar for adapt4/adapt8 and a serial loop with early exit for adapt16. When the `unchecked` feature is enabled on x86_64, adapt4/adapt8/hi_tok switch to inlined SSE2 intrinsics via the `sse2!()` macro pattern (no function call overhead). The bool functions (bool_adapt, bool_equi) stay scalar — they have no data parallelism to exploit.

### Not Ported (With Rationale)

**Scaled MC** (put_8tap_scaled, prep_8tap_scaled, put_bilin_scaled, prep_bilin_scaled) — These functions use per-pixel variable step sizes with per-pixel filter selection, making them fundamentally different from fixed-block MC. The ASM versions are heavily register-scheduled for this pattern. Falls back to scalar Rust. ~2% of profile on inter-frame content.

**SSE-only paths** — 14 files, ~52k lines. The safe SIMD dispatch jumps straight to AVX2 when available. On pre-AVX2 hardware (pre-Haswell, 2013), the decoder falls back to scalar Rust rather than SSE intrinsics. SSE-only x86 hardware is rare enough that maintaining a second intrinsics tier isn't worth the code.

**ARM SVE2, dotprod, i8mm extensions** — `mc_dotprod.S` (1,880 lines) and `mc16_sve.S` (1,649 lines) are optional fast paths for newer ARM cores. The safe SIMD covers baseline NEON; these extension paths fall back to the NEON implementation.

**Remaining AVX-512 paths** — Some AVX-512 paths have been ported (itx, mc, ipred, looprestoration Wiener), but others remain unported. Falls back to AVX2 where not implemented.

**ASM infrastructure files** — `x86inc.asm` (1,983 lines), `asm.S`, `util.S`, `*_tmpl.S`, `*_common.S` are macro libraries and constants that only exist to support the raw assembly. No independent functionality to port.

## Performance

All benchmarks: x86_64 (Zen 4, AVX2), single-threaded, Rust 1.93, fat LTO. Run with `just profile` (500 iterations for IVF, 20 iterations for AVIF).

### Real photographs (AVIF decode, single image)

Single still images at web-typical quality (YUV420, q60). Source: Google-native 8K photo, downscaled with ImageMagick. These numbers reflect real-world AVIF decode performance where SIMD kernels dominate.

| Resolution | ASM | Partial ASM | Safe (checked) | Safe (unchecked) | Safe vs ASM |
|------------|-----|-------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 4K (3840x2561) | 114 ms | 175 ms | 225 ms | 229 ms | 2.0x |
| 8K (8192x5464) | 512 ms | 725 ms | 999 ms | 976 ms | 1.9-2.0x |

### Small test vectors (IVF, multi-frame decode)

dav1d-test-data allintra 352x288 (39 frames). Entropy-heavy bitstream where the serial msac decoder dominates, which compresses the ratio compared to pixel-heavy workloads.

| Build | ms/iter | ms/frame | vs ASM |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| ASM | 92.6 | 2.37 | 1.0x |
| Partial ASM | 131.3 | 3.37 | 1.42x |
| Safe (checked) | 155.6 | 3.99 | 1.68x |
| Safe (unchecked) | 151.8 | 3.89 | 1.64x |

### Where the gap comes from

The safe build is ~2x slower on real images and ~1.7x on entropy-heavy vectors. The gap breaks down:

- **Entropy decoder (msac)**: ~35% of decode time. Serial dependency chain — the core symbol decode loop can't be parallelized. The `partial_asm` feature uses hand-tuned ASM for msac and loopfilter, bringing real photo decodes down to 1.4-1.5x vs full ASM.
- **Calling conventions**: The ASM kernels use custom register allocation across function boundaries. Rust's ABI reloads registers at each call site.
- **Scaled MC**: Falls back to scalar Rust (~2% of inter-frame content). The ASM version uses per-pixel variable-step register scheduling that doesn't map cleanly to safe intrinsics.
- **Bounds checking**: The `unchecked` feature removes runtime bounds checks and DisjointMut borrow tracking. This saves ~2-3% on real photos, confirming the tracking overhead is modest.

### Reproduce locally

```sh
just generate-bench-avif  # create 4K/8K AVIF test images (requires avifdec + avifenc)
just profile              # all four modes side-by-side (ASM, partial ASM, checked, unchecked)
just profile-quick        # same with fewer iterations
```

## Conformance

Tested against the [dav1d-test-data](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d-test-data) suite. MD5 hashes verified at all CPU dispatch levels (scalar, SSE4.2, AVX2, native).

**784 of 803 test vectors pass** across all levels.

19 vectors are not exercised by the test harness:

| Category | Count | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| sframe | 1 | Requires S-frame support |
| svc (operating points) | 6 | Always decodes at default operating point |
| argon (vq_suite) | 12 | Various decode modes and operating point selection tests |

Run conformance tests with `cargo test --release --test decode_cpu_levels`.

## Building

Requires Rust 1.93+ (stable). Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

```sh
# Default safe-SIMD build (recommended)
cargo build --release

# With original hand-written assembly (for benchmarking)
cargo build --features asm --release

# Run tests
cargo test --release
```

### Feature Flags

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `bitdepth_8` | on | 8-bit pixel support |
| `bitdepth_16` | on | 10/12-bit pixel support |
| `unchecked` | off | Skip bounds checks in SIMD hot paths; enables SSE2 msac on x86_64 |
| `partial_asm` | off | ASM for entropy decoding (msac) and loopfilter only; safe SIMD everything else. Implies `unchecked` |
| `c-ffi` | off | C API entry points (`dav1d_*` symbols). Implies `unchecked` |
| `asm` | off | Full hand-written assembly. Implies `c-ffi` |

Safety chain: `default` (`forbid(unsafe_code)`) -> `unchecked` -> `c-ffi` -> `asm`. Each level relaxes the safety constraint.
