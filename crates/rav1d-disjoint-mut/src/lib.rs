//! Provably safe abstraction for concurrent, disjoint mutation of contiguous storage.
//!
//! [`DisjointMut`] wraps a collection and allows non-overlapping mutable borrows
//! through a shared `&` reference. Like [`RefCell`](std::cell::RefCell), it enforces
//! borrowing rules at runtime — but instead of whole-container borrows, it tracks
//! *ranges* and panics only on truly overlapping access.
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! By default, every `.index()` and `.index_mut()` call validates that the requested
//! range doesn't overlap with any outstanding borrow. This makes `DisjointMut` a
//! **sound safe abstraction**: safe code cannot cause undefined behavior.
//!
//! For performance-critical code that has been audited for correctness, the
//! [`DisjointMut::dangerously_unchecked()`] `unsafe` constructor skips runtime
//! tracking. The `unsafe` boundary ensures that opting out of tracking is an
//! explicit, auditable decision — not something that can happen via feature
//! unification or accident.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use rav1d_disjoint_mut::DisjointMut;
//!
//! let mut buf = DisjointMut::new(vec![0u8; 100]);
//! // Borrow two non-overlapping regions simultaneously through &buf:
//! let a = buf.index(0..50);
//! let b = buf.index(50..100);
//! assert_eq!(a.len() + b.len(), 100);
//! ```
