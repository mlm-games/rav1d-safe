# rav1d-safe

Safe SIMD fork of rav1d — 160k lines of hand-written assembly replaced by safe Rust intrinsics.

## Current Sprint: Rayon Threading (through 2026-03-27)

**Goal**: Replace DisjointMut-based threading with rayon scoped parallelism. Three-level ownership:
1. **Tile parallelism**: Safe column splitting via `split_at_mut` per row
2. **SB-row pipeline**: `Recon(N+1) || Filter(N)` on disjoint row ranges, channel deps
3. **Frame parallelism**: Option A (sequential freeze into `Arc<FrozenFrame>`) first

**Spec**: `RAYON-THREADING-SPEC.md` (2027 lines) — complete data access patterns + ownership model.

**Implementation plan** (Phase 1: scalar row-slice validation):
- [x] `PlaneRows` type + `split_rows_by_tiles` column splitter (8 tests)
- [x] Row-slice scalar MC: `put_rows`, `prep_rows`, `put_8tap_rows`, `put_bilin_rows` (4 tests)
- [x] Row-slice scalar compound: `avg_rows`, `w_avg_rows`, `mask_rows`, `blend_rows` (included above)
- [x] Row-slice ITX: `inv_txfm_add_rows` (2 tests)
- [x] Row-slice ipred: DC variants, V, H, paeth, smooth variants, CFL, palette (5 tests)
- [x] Parity tests: 13 cross-validation tests (MC, ITX, ipred, tile integration)
- [x] Rayon pipeline: `run_pipeline` with tile-parallel recon via rayon::scope (5 tests)
- [x] True parallelism: drain + spawn per-tile for concurrent execution
- [x] ProgressiveFrame with monotonic freeze boundary (9 tests)
- [x] Rayon decode path with per-tile Rav1dTaskContext — 14/14 conformance (sequential tiles)
- [x] Actual parallel tile execution — 14/14 conformance with unchecked (rayon::scope::spawn)
- [x] **Measured speedups** (unchecked+rayon, 1920x1080 and 3840x2160 AVIF):
  - 1080p 2-tile: 1.53×, 1080p 4-tile: 2.09×
  - 4K 4-tile: 2.32× (179.9ms → 77.5ms)
  - 4K 8-tile: 3.46× (195.8ms → 56.6ms)
- [x] FramePlanesMut/TilePlaneRows — DisjointMut-free pixel types (3 tests)
- [x] TilePixelBufs — per-tile separate pixel buffers for safe parallel recon
- [ ] Replace PicOffset with TilePlaneRows in recon_b_intra/recon_b_inter
- [ ] Row-slice loopfilter, CDEF, LR, film grain
- [ ] Validate: forbid(unsafe_code) tile-parallel conformance (no unchecked needed)
- [ ] SB-row pipelining via ProgressiveFrame

**Key design**: "re-split, don't persist" — row slices are temporary views per phase, re-created from the flat buffer. Tile recon gets column strips; filtering gets full-width rows.

**PROHIBITION: Do not stop working until rav1d-rayon beats upstream rav1d/dav1d in multithreaded decode performance AND all features (tile threading, frame threading, film grain, super-resolution, all bit depths, all CPU levels) are supported. This is not a suggestion — it is a hard constraint on every session.**

**Work without compromise until Friday 2026-03-27.** This means:
- Commit frequently, push early
- Don't stop to ask permission for incremental steps — never stop to ask anything
- If blocked, try an alternative approach before asking
- Focus on Phase 1 scalar validation — get conformance passing with row slices
- Skip autoversion SIMD and hand-tuned SIMD until scalar validates

## Porting Status

**All major DSP modules ported.** 59k lines of safe Rust SIMD in `src/safe_simd/`.

Completed modules (AVX2 + NEON, 8bpc + 16bpc):
- mc (motion compensation) — including warp_affine
- itx (inverse transforms) — 160 transforms each bpc
- ipred (intra prediction) — all 14 modes
- cdef (directional enhancement)
- loopfilter
- looprestoration (Wiener + SGR)
- filmgrain
- pal (palette)
- refmvs (reference MVs)
- msac (SSE2 adapt4/adapt8/hi_tok when unchecked+x86_64, branchless scalar otherwise, serial loop adapt16)

**Remaining (not ported, scalar fallback):**
- Scaled MC (put_8tap_scaled, prep_8tap_scaled, bilin_scaled) — complex per-pixel filter selection, ~2% of profile
- AVX-512 paths (~26k lines) — falls back to AVX2
- SSE-only paths (~52k lines) — falls back to scalar
- ARM SVE2, dotprod, i8mm — falls back to NEON

## Conformance

784/803 dav1d test vectors pass at all bit depths and all CPU levels (scalar, SSE4, AVX2).
19 failures are infrastructure (1 sframe, 6 SVC operating points, 12 vq_suite decode modes).

## Benchmarks (2026-02-13)

Run via `just profile`. Single-threaded, 500 iters (IVF) / 20 iters (AVIF).

| Checked | 999.4 | 1.95x |
| Unchecked | 976.0 | 1.91x |

Real photos show ~2x vs ASM (SIMD-kernel dominated). Small IVF vectors show 1.64-1.68x (entropy-dominated).
Checked→unchecked gap is tiny on photos (~2-3%), confirming DisjointMut tracking is negligible on real workloads.

## MANDATORY: Safe intrinsics strategy

**Rust 1.93+ made value-type SIMD intrinsics safe.** Computation intrinsics (`_mm256_add_epi32`, `_mm256_shuffle_epi8`, etc.) are now safe functions — no `unsafe` needed.

**Two things still require wrappers:**

1. **Pointer intrinsics (load/store)** — `_mm256_loadu_si256` takes `*const __m256i`, which requires `unsafe`. Use `safe_unaligned_simd` crate which wraps these as safe functions taking `&[T; N]` references. Our `loadu_256!`/`storeu_256!` macros dispatch to these.

2. **Target feature dispatch** — intrinsics are only safe when called within a function annotated with `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]` (or equivalent). `archmage` handles this via token-based dispatch (`Desktop64::summon()`, `#[arcane]`), so we **never manually write `is_x86_feature_detected!()` checks or `#[target_feature]` annotations on our functions**.

3. **Slice access** — Two APIs in `pixel_access.rs`, both zero-cost (verified identical asm):

   **`Flex` trait** — Use in super hot loops where you'd otherwise reach for pointer arithmetic:
   ```rust
   use crate::src::safe_simd::pixel_access::Flex;
   let c = coeff.flex();      // immutable FlexSlice with [] syntax
   let mut d = dst.flex_mut(); // mutable FlexSliceMut with [] syntax
   d[off] = ((d[off] as i32 + c[idx] as i32).clamp(0, 255)) as u8;
   ```
   - `slice.flex()[i]` / `slice.flex()[start..end]` / `slice.flex()[start..]`
   - `slice.flex_mut()[i] = val` / `slice.flex_mut()[start..end]`
   - Natural `[]` syntax, checked by default, unchecked when `unchecked` feature on

   **`SliceExt` trait** — Simpler single-access API:
   - `slice.at(i)` / `slice.at_mut(i)` — single element
   - `slice.sub(start, len)` / `slice.sub_mut(start, len)` — subslice
   - Import: `use crate::src::safe_simd::pixel_access::SliceExt;`

**Do NOT:**
- Manually add `#[target_feature(enable = "...")]` to new functions — use `#[arcane]` instead
- Manually call `is_x86_feature_detected!()` — use `Desktop64::summon()` / `CpuFlags` instead
- Use raw pointer load/store intrinsics — use `loadu_256!` / `storeu_256!` macros instead
- Block on any nightly-only feature for safety — everything works on stable Rust 1.93+

## Feature Flag Safety Model

**`forbid(unsafe_code)` is ON by default.** When `asm`, `c-ffi`, or `unchecked` are enabled, it drops to `deny` so modules can use `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` on specific items (FFI wrappers, unchecked slice access, etc).

```
Default (no asm, no c-ffi, no unchecked): #![forbid(unsafe_code)]  — NO exceptions
asm, c-ffi, or unchecked enabled:         #![deny(unsafe_code)]    — modules can #[allow]
```

This means: **every `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` in the codebase MUST be gated behind `cfg(feature = "asm")`, `cfg(feature = "c-ffi")`, `cfg(feature = "unchecked")`, or `cfg(target_arch)` that excludes the default build.** If an `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` item compiles in the default build, `forbid` will reject it.

## HARD RULES — STOP GOING IN CIRCLES

**READ AND OBEY THESE EVERY TIME. DO NOT SKIP.**

1. **`#[arcane]` NEVER needs `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`.** It is safe by design. If you find yourself adding `allow(unsafe_code)` to an `#[arcane]` function, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. The function body itself must be rewritten to not use `unsafe` — use slices, safe macros, and safe intrinsics.

2. **`#[rite]` NEVER needs `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`.** Same as `#[arcane]` — it's a safe inner helper.

3. **Inner SIMD functions (using core::arch intrinsics) are NOT assembly.** `safe_simd/` contains ZERO `asm!` macros. Do NOT gate inner SIMD functions behind `#[cfg(feature = "asm")]`. Only gate `pub unsafe extern "C" fn` FFI wrappers behind asm.

4. **If an `#[arcane]` function won't compile under `forbid(unsafe_code)`, the function body is wrong.** Rewrite the body to use slices + safe macros. Do NOT add `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`. Do NOT gate behind `#[cfg(feature = "asm")]`.

5. **Read the archmage README before touching dispatch.** `Desktop64::summon()` for detection, `#[arcane]` for entry points, `#[rite]` for inner helpers. The prelude re-exports safe intrinsics. `safe_unaligned_simd` provides reference-based load/store.

6. **Conversion pattern for making `#[arcane]` functions safe:**
   - Change `dst: *mut u8` → `dst: &mut [u8]`
   - Change `coeff: *mut i16` → `coeff: &mut [i16]`
   - Replace `unsafe { *ptr.add(n) }` → `slice[n]`
   - Replace `unsafe { _mm256_loadu_si256(ptr) }` → `loadu_256!(&slice[off..off+32], [u8; 32])`
   - Replace `unsafe { _mm256_storeu_si256(ptr, v) }` → `storeu_256!(&mut slice[off..off+32], [u8; 32], v)`
   - Replace `unsafe { _mm_cvtsi32_si128(*(ptr as *const i32)) }` → `loadi32!(&slice[off..off+4])`
   - Remove ALL `unsafe {}` blocks — if intrinsics need unsafe, you're not in a `#[target_feature]` context (use `#[arcane]`/`#[rite]`)

7. **When you don't know how something works, READ THE README/DOCS FIRST.** Do not guess. Do not add workarounds. Especially for archmage, zerocopy, safe_unaligned_simd.

- aarch64: Full support, NEON (cargo check --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu passes)

## Architecture

### Dispatch Pattern

rav1d uses function pointer dispatch for SIMD:
1. `wrap_fn_ptr!` macro creates type-safe function pointer wrappers
2. For asm: `bd_fn!` macro links to asm symbols, `call` method invokes fn ptr
3. For non-asm: `call` method uses `cfg_if` to call `*_dispatch` directly (no fn ptrs)
4. `*_dispatch` functions do `Desktop64::summon()` or `CpuFlags::AVX2` check, call inner SIMD

### FFI Wrapper Pattern (asm only)

FFI wrappers are gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "asm")]`:
```rust
#[cfg(all(feature = "asm", target_arch = "x86_64"))]
#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn function_8bpc_avx2(
    dst: *const FFISafe<...>,
    // ... other params
) {
    let dst = unsafe { *FFISafe::get(dst) };
    // Call inner implementation
}
```

## Safety Status

**MILESTONE: `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` ACHIEVED for default build** (commit b67f378).

The default build (`cargo build --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16"`) compiles
under `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — the compiler guarantees zero unsafe in the entire crate when
neither `asm` nor `c-ffi` features are enabled.

All unsafe is now confined to:
- `rav1d-disjoint-mut` sub-crate (PicBuf, Align types, AlignedVec AsMutPtr impls)
- Code gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "asm")]` or `#[cfg(feature = "c-ffi")]`

**How unsafe was eliminated from the default build:**
- `picture.rs`: `Rav1dPictureDataComponentInner = PicBuf` (type alias to disjoint-mut crate type)
- `msac.rs`: `MsacAsmContextBuf { pos: usize, end: usize }` (indices, not pointers)
- `c_box.rs`: No custom Drop without c-ffi → destructurable, no Pin::new_unchecked
- `c_arc.rs`: `Arc<Box<T>>` with safe view slicing (no StableRef, no raw pointers)
- `assume.rs`: Gated behind c-ffi (only used by picture.rs ExternalAsMutPtr)
- `align.rs`: Align types + ExternalAsMutPtr moved to disjoint-mut crate
- `internal.rs`: Send/Sync auto-derived (no manual unsafe impls needed)
- `partial_simd.rs`: Safe `#[target_feature(enable = "sse2")]` wrappers (Rust 1.93+)

**C FFI types gated behind `cfg(feature = "c-ffi")`:**
- `DavdPicture`, `DavdData`, `DavdDataProps`, `DavdUserData`, `DavdSettings`, `DavdLogger` — all gated
- `ITUTT35PayloadPtr`, `Dav1dITUTT35` struct (with `Send`/`Sync` impls) — gated; safe type alias when c-ffi off
- `RawArc`, `RawCArc`, `Dav1dContext`, `arc_into_raw` — gated (raw Arc ptr roundtrip)
- `From<Dav1d*>` / `From<Rav1d*> for Dav1d*` conversions (containing `unsafe { CArc::from_raw }`) — all gated
- Safe picture allocator: per-plane `Vec<u8>` from MemPool, no C callbacks needed
- Fallible allocation: `MemPool::pop_init` returns `Result<Vec, TryReserveError>`, propagated as `Rav1dError::ENOMEM`

**c-ffi build fully working** (previously blocked by 320 `forge_token_dangerously` errors in safe_simd):
- Fixed: wrapped all `forge_token_dangerously()` calls in `unsafe { }` blocks (Rust 2024 edition compliance)
- Both `cargo check --features c-ffi` and `cargo test --features c-ffi` pass clean

**FFI wrappers gated behind `feature = "asm"`** in: cdef, cdef_arm, loopfilter, loopfilter_arm, looprestoration, looprestoration_arm, filmgrain, filmgrain_arm, pal.

**Archmage conversions complete:** cdef constrain_avx2. msac SSE2 uses sse2!() macro (not archmage).

**Feature flags:**
- `unchecked` - Use unchecked slice access in SIMD hot paths (skips bounds checks)
- `src/safe_simd/pixel_access.rs` - Helper module for checked/unchecked slice access + SIMD macros

**Writing Clean Safe SIMD (the complete pattern):**

Since Rust 1.93, value-type SIMD intrinsics are safe functions. The only remaining sources of `unsafe` in SIMD are:
1. **Pointer load/store** — `_mm256_loadu_si256(*const)` takes raw pointers
2. **Target feature dispatch** — intrinsics are only safe inside `#[target_feature(enable = "...")]` fns

Both are solved without any `unsafe` in user code:

```rust
// 1. Module header — forbid unsafe (load/store macros handle it internally):
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "unchecked"), forbid(unsafe_code))]

// 2. Import macros from pixel_access:
use super::pixel_access::{loadu_256, storeu_256, load_256, store_256};

// 3. Functions take SLICES, not raw pointers:
// 4. Use #[arcane] for target_feature dispatch (NOT manual #[target_feature]):
#[arcane]
fn process(token: Desktop64, dst: &mut [u8], src: &[u8], w: usize) {
    // Load 32 bytes from slice — safe, bounds-checked:
    let v = load_256!(&src[0..32], [u8; 32]);

    // All computation intrinsics are safe (Rust 1.93+):
    let doubled = _mm256_add_epi8(v, v);
    let shuffled = _mm256_shuffle_epi8(doubled, _mm256_setzero_si256());

    // Store 32 bytes to slice — safe, bounds-checked:
    store_256!(&mut dst[0..32], [u8; 32], shuffled);

    // Or use typed array ref forms (no slice→array conversion):
    let arr: &[u8; 32] = src[0..32].try_into().unwrap();
    let v = loadu_256!(arr);
    storeu_256!(<&mut [u8; 32]>::try_from(&mut dst[0..32]).unwrap(), v);
}
```

**Why this works with `forbid(unsafe_code)`:**
- `#[arcane]` (from archmage crate) handles `#[target_feature]` dispatch via tokens — no manual feature annotations needed
- `load_256!`/`store_256!` expand to `safe_unaligned_simd` calls (safe, bounds-checked) when `unchecked` is off
- Computation intrinsics (`_mm256_add_epi8`, `_mm256_shuffle_epi8`, etc.) are plain safe functions since Rust 1.93
- Result: **zero `unsafe` blocks** in the SIMD function body

**When `unchecked` is ON:** macros expand to `unsafe { _mm256_loadu_si256(ptr) }` with `debug_assert!` only — maximum perf, `deny(unsafe_code)` instead of `forbid`.

**Load/Store macros (in `pixel_access.rs`):**

| Macro | Width | Input | Description |

**Slice access helpers (in `pixel_access.rs`):**

| Helper | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `row_slice(buf, off, len)` | Immutable `&[u8]` — unchecked when feature enabled |
| `row_slice_mut(buf, off, len)` | Mutable `&mut [u8]` — unchecked when feature enabled |
| `row_slice_u16(buf, off, len)` | Immutable `&[u16]` variant |
| `row_slice_u16_mut(buf, off, len)` | Mutable `&mut [u16]` variant |
| `idx(buf, i)` / `idx_mut(buf, i)` | Single element access |
| `reinterpret_slice(src)` | Safe zerocopy type reinterpretation |

**Migration checklist for converting a SIMD function to safe:**
1. Change fn signature: raw pointers → slices (`*mut u8` → `&mut [u8]`)
2. Add `#[arcane]` attribute, take `Desktop64` token param
3. Replace `unsafe { _mm256_loadu_si256(ptr) }` → `load_256!(&slice[off..off+32], [u8; 32])`
4. Replace `unsafe { _mm256_storeu_si256(ptr, v) }` → `store_256!(&mut slice[off..off+32], [u8; 32], v)`
5. Remove `unsafe {}` blocks around computation intrinsics (they're safe since 1.93)
6. Add `#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "unchecked"), forbid(unsafe_code))]` to module
7. Gate FFI `extern "C"` wrappers behind `#[cfg(feature = "asm")]`

**Unsafe reduction progress (safe_simd/):**
- **itx.rs: ✅ FULLY SAFE when asm off** — all 85 #[arcane] fns converted from raw pointers to slices, 0 unsafe outside #[cfg(feature = "asm")] FFI wrappers
- **filmgrain.rs: ✅ 0 allows** — all dispatch safe via zerocopy AsBytes/FromBytes
- **pixel_access.rs: ✅ 0 allows** — SliceExt trait + FlexSlice zero-cost wrapper
- **itx_arm.rs: ✅ 0 allows** — all FFI correctly gated behind asm
- **ipred.rs: ✅ 0 allows** — all 28 inner SIMD fns converted to safe slices
- **mc.rs: ✅ FULLY SAFE when asm off** — 29 rite fns converted from raw pointers to slices, 0 unsafe outside FFI wrappers
- mc_arm.rs: 10 allows (FFI gated, inner fns use NEON intrinsics)
- filmgrain_arm.rs: 8 allows (FFI gated, inner fns use NEON)
- loopfilter_arm.rs: 3 allows
- cdef.rs: 2 allows (test module calling #[target_feature] fns)
- refmvs.rs/refmvs_arm.rs: 1 allow each
- ipred_arm.rs: 1 allow
- All safe_simd dispatch functions use tracked DisjointMut guards
- Pixels trait gated behind cfg(asm) — dead code when asm disabled

**c-ffi decoupled from fn-ptr dispatch.** The `c-ffi` feature now only controls the 19 `dav1d_*` extern "C" entry points in `src/lib.rs`. Internal DSP dispatch uses direct function calls (no function pointers) when `asm` is disabled.

## Managed Safe API

**Location:** `src/managed.rs` (~970 lines, 100% safe Rust)

A fully safe, zero-copy API for decoding AV1 video. Enforced by `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.

**Key types:**
- `Decoder` - safe wrapper around `Rav1dContext` (new/with_settings/decode/flush/drop)
- `Settings` - type-safe configuration with `InloopFilters`, `DecodeFrameType` enums
- `Frame` - decoded frame with metadata (width, height, bit depth, color info, HDR)
- `Planes` - enum dispatching to `Planes8`/`Planes16` for type-safe pixel access
- `PlaneView8`/`PlaneView16` - zero-copy 2D strided views holding `DisjointImmutGuard`
- `Error` - simple error enum with `From<Rav1dError>` (no thiserror dependency)

**Color/HDR metadata:**
- `ColorPrimaries`, `TransferCharacteristics`, `MatrixCoefficients` - color space info
- `ColorRange` - Limited vs Full
- `ContentLightLevel` - HDR max/avg nits
- `MasteringDisplay` - SMPTE 2086 with nit conversion helpers

**Input format:**
- Expects raw OBU (Open Bitstream Unit) data, not container formats
- For IVF files, use an IVF parser to extract OBU frames (see `tests/ivf_parser.rs`)
- For Annex B or Section 5 low overhead formats, additional parsing may be needed

**Threading:**
- Default: `threads: 1` (single-threaded, deterministic, synchronous)
- `threads: 0`: Auto-detect cores (frame threading, better performance, asynchronous)
- With frame threading, `decode()` may return `None` for complete frames (call again or `flush()`)

**Usage example:**
```rust
use rav1d_safe::src::managed::Decoder;

let mut decoder = Decoder::new()?;
if let Some(frame) = decoder.decode(obu_data)? {
    match frame.planes() {
        Planes::Depth8(planes) => {
            for row in planes.y().rows() {
                // Process 8-bit row
            }
        }
        Planes::Depth16(planes) => {
            let pixel = planes.y().pixel(0, 0);
        }
    }
}
```

**Tests:**
- `tests/managed_api_test.rs` - unit tests (decoder creation, settings, empty data)
- `tests/integration_decode.rs` - integration tests with real IVF test vectors (2/2 passing)

### GitHub Actions Workflows

Build matrix: `{x86_64, aarch64, wasm32-wasi (simd128)} × {linux, macos, windows}`

Workflow must include:
- `cargo build --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16"` (pure safe)
- `cargo build --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16,c-ffi"` (safe + C API)

- wasm32 simd128 build check

### Decode Parity Testing (IMPLEMENTED)

**Comparison harness:** `/home/lilith/work/zenavif/examples/compare_libavif.rs`

Compares zenavif (rav1d-safe) vs libavif RGB output at multiple CPU feature levels.

**Reference images:** Pre-generated libavif PNGs at `/mnt/v/output/zenavif/libavif-refs/` (3247 files).
Generated via avifdec at `/home/lilith/work/libavif/build/avifdec`.

**Dataset:** 3261 AVIF files at `/mnt/v/datasets/scraping/avif/` (unsplash, google-native, wikimedia, unsplash-scale).

**CPU Feature Level Override:**
- `rav1d_set_cpu_flags_mask(mask)` — global, applies to all safe_simd dispatch
- `Settings { cpu_flags_mask: mask, .. }` — per-decoder in managed API
- `DecoderConfig::new().cpu_flags_mask(mask)` — per-decoder in zenavif
- All safe_simd dispatch functions check `crate::src::cpu::summon_avx2()` which gates on the mask

| Level | Mask | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| v3-avx2 | `0xFFFFFFFF` | AVX2 + FMA (default, full SIMD) |
| v2-sse4 | `0b0111` (7) | SSE4.1 only (no AVX2 dispatch) |
| scalar | `0` | No SIMD (pure Rust scalar) |

**Running comparisons:**
```bash
cd /home/lilith/work/zenavif

# All levels (v3, v2, scalar) on full dataset
./target/release/examples/compare_libavif

# Specific level
./target/release/examples/compare_libavif --level v3
./target/release/examples/compare_libavif --level scalar

# Custom directories
./target/release/examples/compare_libavif /path/to/avif/dir /path/to/refs --level all
```

**Reports:** Written to `/mnt/v/output/zenavif/comparison-{level}.txt`

**Note:** Error categories are vs libavif RGB output (YUV→RGB rounding differences expected):
- Exact: 0 error
- Close: max error ≤ 2 (rounding)
- Minor: max error ≤ 10
- Major: max error > 10 (potential bug)

## Known Issues

### DisjointMut overlaps with tile threading (partially fixed)

**Status:** Level cache overlap FIXED. Picture plane overlap OPEN.

With `threads > 1` and `max_frame_delay = 1` (tile threading, no frame threading),
DisjointMut guards overlap between concurrent tile tasks:

**FIXED (e2de9f1):** `f.lf.level` (loopfilter level cache) — SIMD loopfilter dispatch
acquired an immutable guard spanning the entire remaining buffer. Fix: gather ~32 needed
level entries into a `[[u8; 4]; 34]` stack buffer, drop the DisjointMut guard immediately,
pass the compact buffer to inner functions with `b4_stride=1`. Zero allocations, ~128 bytes
copied. Both x86_64 and aarch64/wasm paths fixed. 784/784 conformance vectors pass.

**OPEN:** Picture plane pixel data — `backup2lines` in `cdef_apply.rs` reads 2 rows of
pixels from the current frame (immutable guard ~1536 bytes at 768w 8bpc), while a concurrent
tile thread writes reconstructed pixels in an adjacent SB row (mutable guard). The 40-byte
overlap is at the SB row boundary. Fix requires tightening pixel data guards in:
- `cdef_apply.rs`: `backup2lines` reads (line 55, 75)
- `safe_simd/mc.rs`: 15 `full_guard`/`full_guard_mut` calls (x86_64)
- `safe_simd/mc_arm.rs`: 18 `full_guard` calls (aarch64)
- `safe_simd/loopfilter_arm.rs`: 9 `full_guard` + whole-buffer lvl guards

The pattern is the same as the level cache fix: acquire a narrow guard covering only the
rows actually accessed, or copy needed data to a local buffer and drop the guard immediately.

Reproducer: `cargo test --release --test reproduce_overlap -- --ignored`

### ARM loopfilter_arm.rs:69 — index out of bounds on aarch64

Discovered during `just test-aarch64` (QEMU emulation). The scalar loopfilter fallback in
`loopfilter_arm.rs:69` computes `signed_idx(base, strideb * -2)` which wraps to a huge index
when `strideb` is negative. The `decode_cpu_levels` integration tests fail on aarch64 with:
`index out of bounds: the len is 32768 but the index is 18446744073709550596`.
Lib-only tests pass fine — issue is in the scalar loopfilter path exercised by full decode.

## Technical Notes

### Key Constants
- `REST_UNIT_STRIDE = 390` for looprestoration (256 * 3/2 + 3 + 3)
- `intermediate_bits = 4` for 8bpc MC filters
- pmulhrsw rounding: `(a * b + 16384) >> 15`

### SIMD Intrinsics
- Use `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]` for FFI wrappers
- Shift intrinsics require const generics: `_mm256_srai_epi32::<11>(sum)`
- Mark inner implementations `unsafe fn` with explicit `unsafe {}` blocks

## Known Issues - Managed API

### ✅ RESOLVED: Thread Cleanup and Joining

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** (Commit 2e49d9c)

Fixed architecture flaw where worker thread JoinHandles were stored inside Arc<Rav1dContext>, creating circular ownership that prevented proper thread cleanup.

**Solution:** Moved JoinHandles out of Arc and into Decoder struct. Decoder::drop() now signals workers to die and joins them synchronously.

**Verification:**
- All thread cleanup tests pass (run with `--test-threads=1`)
- No deadlocks
- No thread leaks
- Proper panic propagation

See THREAD_FIX_COMPLETE.md for full implementation details.

### ✅ RESOLVED: Panic Safety and Memory Management

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED SAFE**

The managed API (`src/managed.rs`) uses the safe `Rav1dData` wrapper with `CArc<[u8]>` (Arc-based smart pointer), not the unsafe `Dav1dData` C FFI struct. The implementation is panic-safe:

1. **Automatic cleanup via RAII**: `Rav1dData` contains `Option<CArc<[u8]>>` which properly implements Drop through Arc's reference counting
2. **Panic safety verified**: Stack unwinding correctly drops `Rav1dData`, cleaning up resources even on panic
3. **No manual memory management**: The managed API never calls `dav1d_data_wrap`/`dav1d_data_unref` directly

**Testing:**
- `tests/panic_safety_test.rs` - 4 tests verifying panic safety and proper Drop behavior
- All tests pass under normal operation and panic conditions
- Memory leak detection via ASAN/LSAN can be added to CI for additional verification

**Note:** The unsafe `Dav1dData` C FFI struct (used when `feature = "c-ffi"` is enabled) does NOT implement Drop and could leak on panic. However, this is not used by the managed API and only affects direct C FFI users who must manage `dav1d_data_unref` manually.

### Recommended: Memory Leak Detection in CI

**Status:** ⚠️ Enhancement

While the managed API is structurally sound, adding ASAN/LSAN to CI would provide additional confidence:

**Justfile additions:**
```bash
# Run tests with AddressSanitizer
test-asan:
    RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo +nightly test --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16" --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Run tests with LeakSanitizer
test-lsan:
    RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=leak" cargo +nightly test --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16" --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

**CI workflow addition:**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with ASAN
  run: |
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo +nightly test --no-default-features --features "bitdepth_8,bitdepth_16" --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Recommended: Thread Pool Cleanup Verification

**Status:** ℹ️ Low Priority

The `Rav1dContext` manages a thread pool for frame threading. While the Drop implementation appears correct, explicit verification would be valuable:

**Areas to verify:**
- `Arc<TaskThreadData>` drop implementation in `src/internal.rs`
- Worker threads join properly on context drop
- No hanging threads or leaked thread handles

**Test approach:**
```rust
#[test]
fn test_decoder_thread_cleanup() {
    let initial_threads = thread_count();
    {
        let mut decoder = Decoder::with_settings(Settings {
            threads: 0, // Auto-detect cores
            ..Default::default()
        }).unwrap();
        decoder.decode(test_data).unwrap();
    }
    // Give OS time to clean up threads
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
    let final_threads = thread_count();
    assert_eq!(initial_threads, final_threads);
}
```



## Feature Dependency Chain

```
default:    #![forbid(unsafe_code)] — compiler-enforced, zero unsafe
  └─> unchecked: get_unchecked in hot paths, debug_assert! bounds checks
       └─> c-ffi: unsafe extern "C" FFI wrappers, raw pointer conversions
            └─> asm: hand-written x86_64/aarch64 assembly via function pointers
```

**Cargo.toml:**
```toml
[features]
default = ["bitdepth_8", "bitdepth_16"]
unchecked = ["rav1d-disjoint-mut/unchecked"]
c-ffi = ["unchecked"]
asm = ["c-ffi"]
```

All unsafe in the default build is confined to the `rav1d-disjoint-mut` sub-crate (PicBuf, Align types, AlignedVec AsMutPtr impls). The main crate is provably safe — auditors only need to review the small sub-crate.
